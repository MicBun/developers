# Code of Conduct

1. Make sure you are aligned with our core [Holdex values](https://holdex.io/about).
2. Ensure the quality of your work. It is a sign of poor ownership and lack of confidence when you expect someone to deal with your incomplete work.
3. Assign yourself to the Problem you are solving so others are aware of it.
4. Donâ€™t use `@mention` when it is not crucial for the person to be notified. Use "reactions" (likes) instead.
5. Leave updates daily to keep things transparent and simple for others.
