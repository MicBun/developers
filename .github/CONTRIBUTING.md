# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Accepted contributions will be reflected on [holdex.io](https://holdex.io) or other related websites and repositories. 

Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Getting started

There are 3 core contribution pillars:
1. **Goal** – a business aim
1. **Problem** – an issue that is on the way to help us achieve the goal
1. **Solution** –  the actual deliverable which resolves the problem

> [!NOTE]
> In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow: from finding a Goal, identifying a Problem, and the process of delivering your solutions.

### Goal

As soon as you get involved, you must understand the goal you are wokring on by

1. investigating the conversations and related documents
1. understanding how things are already moving towards achieving the goal 

It is crucial to understand the business context of the goal and how achieving the goal will impact the project.

> [!NOTE]
> A Goal is representaed as a GitHub issue in the relevant repository and has the following naming pattern: `Goal: [statement]`. Goals are created and managed by Partner level contributors.

### Problem
Once the goal is clear, you must identify what stops us from achieving it. Anything that is stopping us - is a “Problem”. A typical question to ask is: "why this Goal is not achived yet and what is the Problem?".

Sometimes, a Goal already has a few identified problems, but it’s not always the case.

> [!NOTE]
> Once a Problems is identified, we report it as a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) with the following following naming pattern: `Problem: [statement]`. We’re counting on our contributors to identify problems.

### Solution
The third pillar of successful contribution is the Solution.

Different problems may require different set of skills.  
Whether it’s code, design, or marketing material, we expect a lean and clean solution from the contributor.

> [!NOTE]
> If the source-code modification is required, the solution is presented as [GitHub PR (Pull Request)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). PRs must comply with PR Requirements.

#### PR Requirements

> [!WARNING]
> PRs that do not correspond to the following criterias are usually rejected.

1. **Small size**. [Keep PRs small](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2021/03/09/strategies-for-small-focused-pull-requests/) and completable within 3-4 hours. If the solution requires more time, then decompose is into smaller PRs.
1. **Clear naming**. When creating PRs and commits follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) guidelines. Keep it [clean and simple](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/develop-semantic-title/#how-to-write-good-pr-titles).
1. **Stalled PR**. We usually reject and close PRs which do not have ativity for the last 24 hours. Unless there is a clear comment in thas PR explaining a reason why that PR is stalled.
